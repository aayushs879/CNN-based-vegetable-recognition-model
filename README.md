# CNN-based-vegetable-recognition-model
This project was a part of the work done by me and my team for All India Research Championship organized at IIT Kanpur. This is a CNN based image recognition model made on keras and tensorflow. The dataset was quite small and the overall validation accuracy obtained was 89% on the validation set.
